                <h2>Early days</h2>
                <p>
                    Arrow's early life, like Arrow himself, are a mystery. Found in a Fresno shelter in 2017, Arrow was rescued by volunteers at <a href="https://www.wigglytails.org/">Wiggly Tails Dog Rescue</a> and transported to Eugene. It was at that time that his human, Krista, met Arrow and fell in love with his enormous ears and soulful eyes. It was clear that Arrow needed a person as much as Krista needed a dog. At first, Arrow was a vibrating powder keg of fearful energy. He hid constantly and barked at other dogs, people, cars, shadows, sounds - at anything and everything. During the early days, the world was a scary and unpredictable place. It was clear that Arrow would need nearly unlimited patience, stability, routine, positive reinforcement, and training from his human. It was equally clear that Arrow had boundless love to share if given the chance. And so it began.
