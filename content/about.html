                    <h2>Early days</h2>
                    <p>
                        Arrow's early life, like Arrow himself, are a mystery. Found in a Fresno shelter in 2017, Arrow was rescued by volunteers at <a href="https://www.wigglytails.org/">Wiggly Tails Dog Rescue</a> and transported to Eugene. 
                        It was at that time that his human, Krista, met Arrow and fell in love with his enormous ears and soulful eyes. It was clear that Arrow needed a person as much as Krista needed a dog. 
                        At first, Arrow was a vibrating powder keg of fearful energy. He hid constantly and barked at other dogs, people, cars, shadows, sounds - at anything and everything. 
                        During the early days, the world was a scary and unpredictable place. It was clear that Arrow would benefit from patience, stability, routine, positive reinforcement, and training from his human. 
                        It was equally clear that Arrow had boundless love to share if given the chance. And so it began.

                    <h2>Arrow Now</h2>
                    <p>
                        Arrow has made incredible progress since he first arrived in Eugene. He spends his days napping, watching squirrels from the window, going on walks, playing in his big back yard, and receiving all the cuddles he could ask for. 
                        After several years of very hard work, Arrow's reactivity to other dogs even decreased to the point that his two humans were able to adopt a second Wiggly Tails dog, Oreo. Arrow and Oreo became fast friends and are now inseparable. 
                        They have been a wonderful influence on each other with Oreo helping to boost Arrow's confidence and independence from his humans and Arrow demonstrating the rules of the house for Oreo. Both Arrow and Oreo are very, very good dogs who are very much loved.
