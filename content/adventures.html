                        Over the past several years, Arrow has made appearances accross the continental United States. In January of 2017, Arrow made the arduous journey from <strong>Fresno, California</strong>, to his current residence in <strong>Eugene, Oregon.</strong> Later that year, he traveled by plane to visit family in <strong>Shillington, Pennsylvania</strong>, where he made his very first dog-friend, Strider, a happy-go-lucky Viszla. Arrow has also made multiple trips to <strong>Olympia, Washington</strong>, where is reliably greated with adoration by his extended human family.

                        Like many Oregonians, Arrow is an avid hiker who thoroughly enjoys the outdoors. While the climate is a bit wet for his taste, Arrow considers it a small cost for the beneit of exploring the natural beauty that Oregon has to offer. In fact, the day after joining his family in Eugene, Arrow celebrated by hiking Spencer's Butte, impressing everyone with his tenacity and ability to scrabble up even the steepest of rock outcroppings. The nostalgia of that first Spencer's Butte has secured it's place as Arrow's favorite hiking route. Other hikes that Arrow particularly enjoys include Mt. Pisgah and Skinner's Butte.

                        In addition to hikes with elevation increases, Arrow enjoys more leisurely walks through the woods and along the Willamette River. The river bank is close enough to the water, though, as Arrow is not found of cold water. Or tepid water. Or really any water.

                    <h2>Biking</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of Arrow's favorite activies is running alongside his bicycle-riding human. Despite his short stature, Arrow is lightening fast. In fact, he is so fast that even in high gear, it takes substantial effort to set a pace fast enough for him. During these bike rides, Arrow is able to leave all his cares behind and live in the moment of sheer joy that comes with the wind in his fur and the ground passing steadily beneath his feet.
